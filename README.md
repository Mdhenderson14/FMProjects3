## My process

Completing the HTML wasn't difficult, but to complete the CSS I typed my next steps w/ code into Copilot to confirm/ deny that I was moving in the right direction.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VSCode
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Overall, this challenge wasn't terribly difficult after I realized I had not linked my CSS correctly.

HTML was easy to complete. Copilot suggested that I use an img-container for the img, which made styling a ton easier.

'Justify' always signals a horizontal adjustment

'Align' always signals a vertical adjustment

align-content v. align-items
- content: used for mulit-line flex-containers
- items: ideal for single-line layouts

Make a habit of hiding the overflow.

### Continued development

I want to know when it's best to use a flexbox v. a grid.

I want to know when to use certain units of measurment (px v. rem v. %).

Media queries was a still little shakey for me, and I would like to know how to create them w/out assistance.
- Also, I'm not sure if I styled all of my margin and/or paddings correctly or if the media queries made them look nice.
